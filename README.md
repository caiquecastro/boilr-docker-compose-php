## What is this?

Boilr is a tool for generating your projects boilerplate files. This template repository provides templates for generating docker-compose.yml for PHP projects.

These templates are configued based on MY personal opinion on how docker-compose works best for PHP projects

After the YAML files are generated, you may need to tweak slightly (Node entrypoint, etc)
